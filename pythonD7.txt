Code Orginization and Backend Mindset

1. Backend code must be:
    -Readable
    -maintainable
    -extensible

2.Core Backend Rule
-One responsiblity per function

3.Logical Grouping
Think in Section:
    -Data
    -Presistence
    -CRUD Logical
    -Program Flow

4.Introducing main()
Python doesn't force main(), but backend developers use it 
This gives you:
    -One clear entry point
    -Better Readability
    -Easier testing
